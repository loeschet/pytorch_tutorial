# pytorch_tutorial
A simple pytorch tutorial for developing a DNN model for a regression and a classification task.

**Note: Still under active development!**

This tutorial uses two datasets: We use a subset of the HIGGS dataset ([link](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/HIGGS)) for the classification task and the WHO life expectancy dataset ([link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who)) for the regression task.

The tasks are solved with a very simple fully connected network architecture, implemented in [`pytorch`](https://pytorch.org/). The main idea is to get familiar with the `pytorch` library in general and be able to make use of it in different other projects.

The main code is contained in the jupyter notebook `pytorch_tutorial.ipynb`, which can be used to run the tutorial on a local machine. It also exists on google colab via [this link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1Tbm5cxHc0SWinhcDw0cmrAY_jXwJpuX2?usp=sharing). The access to the colab notebook is restricted, so interested users need to create a copy in their google drive.
